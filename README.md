# System Design 2

**Designing Instagram**

**What to be designed?**

1. Instagram is a social networking service that allows users to upload their photos and videos and share them with other users.
2. Users of Instagram may opt to share information either privately or publicly.
3. Any publicly shared content can be seen by any other user, while privately shared content can be accessed only by a specified set of people.
4. We plan to design a simpler version of Instagram for the sake of this exercise, where a user can share photos and follow other users too.
5. For each user the 'News Feed' will consist of top photos of all the people that the user follows.
